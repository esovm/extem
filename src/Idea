resolving a target:
    look through all the rules
        if has the rule where the target is the result
            get the left side
            solve the left
            if solved
                record
            else
                next rule
    if not solved
        undecideable

Solving the expression:
    if not
        get the parameter
        if bool
            not value
        else
            if expression
                resolve sub-expression
                if resolved
                    value
                else
                    undecideable
            if atomic
                push it to the targets list
                resolve
                save result
    else
        get left hand side
        solve
        if solved
            if true
                if or
                    solved
                else
                    solve right hand side
        else
            if or
                solve right hand side
                if solved
                    value
